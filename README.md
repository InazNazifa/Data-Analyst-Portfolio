## About
Hi, I'm Inaz! I am a highly motivated and aspiring pure mathematics student with a solid foundation in statistical analysis, 
machine learning and data visualization with a strong background in mathematics and programming. 
Feel free to explore the projects and learn more about the methodologies, datasets, and tools Iâ€™ve used. I hope you find my work interesting and informative. 

## Portfolio Projects

In this section, I will list data analytics projects and briefly describing the technology stack used to solve case studies.

### Python Projects

#### Titanic Survival Analysis

- **Code**: [Titanic Survival.ipynb](https://github.com/Haritha1005/DATA-ANALYSIS-PORTFOLIO/blob/main/App%20Ratings%20Prediction.ipynb)
- **Goal**: To analyze the survival rates of Titanic passengers based on the age groups, gender and fare distribution across pasenger classes.
- **Description**: The project focuses on a thorough analysis of the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival using machine learning. The dataset contains demographic and travel-related information about the passengers aboard the Titanic. The project involves data preprocessing, including handling missing data, feature engineering, and building a classification model to predict survival outcomes. The analysis includes detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover the relationships between passenger characteristics and survival rates.
- **Skills**: Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature, visualization.
- **Technology**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn.
